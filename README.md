# Yarmonics Sound Map

This project was a comission for the [Yarmonics festival](https://www.yarmonics.com/) as a place to listen to previous performances from the festival throughout the years.

Performance locations are shown on the map as pins that can be clicked on to open a modal that shows all the performances in that location with some information and an embedded Soundcloud player to listen to the performances.

Performances can be added to the map by Yarmonics Festival staff via the [Heroku hosted Strapi CMS UI](https://github.com/edpe/yarmonics-map-cms)

The technology and hosting was selected to accomodate the project which required the map to have no ongoing costs. The Map has been running for a number of years now.
